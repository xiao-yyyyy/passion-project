## Proposal
**1.Description**

For this project, I want to create an artwork with a heart using the code.

It will not be just a single heart; tiny sequins will spread around it, and the heart in the center will beat like a real heart. As shown below.

This idea comes from a Chinese TV Drama I have watched, the main characters were computer programmers, and they create a heart just like this.

But I will make some changes with the heart, such as the heart in the TV series seems to be a little stuck when it beats. I hope to change my heart to a smoother beating. And the tiny sequins around it can be scattered to the surroundings regularly, instead of surrounding the heart motionless. If I have enought time, I will try to add a click code to make the tiny sequins move aroud different rules, and try to make it change into different colors after very brat.


**2.Why and How**

The reason why I want to creat this hreat is because I like this TV series, and I'm very intrested about how did they made this heart. I think it's a very romantic art, and it looks cool to draw such a artwork in computer code. So I want to make something similer with it in this project.
